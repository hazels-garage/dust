## ultrathin sweep-alike

**dust** is my attempt at making the thinnest sweep-alike while experimenting.  In theory, this could be as low as 7mm total. ðŸ¤ž

### Sacrifices were made.  

- XIAO is surface mounted to be reversible without jumpers.  
- There is no reset button because the xiao has one on it.  
- Soldering the battery connection on the XIAO is gonna suck.
- You're probably gonna need to tape the battery to the board.
- The XSwitch and XIAO footprints were created by me and _might_ work.  
- There is a good chance this won't work at all in its current state
- I could've done 36 key, but then I wouldn't have enough X Switches to build a 36 key later.
